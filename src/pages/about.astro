      <!-- Story -->

        <h2>The short version</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a tech consultant based in Surrey, working with small businesses across the UK.
          I've spent years in enterprise tech — large-scale projects, complex systems, big budgets.
          Now I help smaller teams get the same results without the complexity (or the price tag).
        </p>

        <h2>Why I do this</h2>
        <p>
          Small businesses deserve better than overpriced agencies, cookie-cutter solutions,
          and "experts" who disappear after the invoice is paid. I've seen too many business
          owners burned by tech projects that promised the world and delivered confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work differently. I start by understanding what you're actually trying to achieve.
          Then I tell you honestly what's worth doing — and what isn't. No upselling, no jargon,
          no solutions looking for problems.
        </p>

        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p>
          I use modern tools (including AI) to work faster and smarter. That means quicker
          turnaround and better value for you. But the tools are just tools — what matters
          is understanding your business and delivering something that actually helps.
        </p>
        <p>
          You work with me directly. Not a rotating team, not a junior who's "learning on the job".
          When you have a question, you get an answer from someone who knows your project inside out.
        </p>

        <h2>The boring but important bit</h2>
        <p>
          MP Consulting is a trading name of Morfology Ltd, registered in England.
          I'm based in Farnham, Surrey, but work with clients across the UK (and occasionally beyond).
