Your website should bring you business, not just exist.

Most small business websites are either outdated, slow, or just don't convert visitors into enquiries. You know you need something better, but the thought of a six-month project with a web agency fills you with dread.

## What you get

A modern, fast website that's designed to generate leads. Not a template with your logo slapped on - a site built around how your customers actually find and choose you.

- **Fast to build** — I work in weeks, not months
- **Built for conversion** — Clear calls to action, not just pretty pictures
- **Easy to update** — You can change content without calling me
- **Mobile-first** — Because that's where your customers are
- **SEO-ready** — Proper foundations so you can be found

## How it works

1. We talk about your business and who you're trying to reach
2. I dig into what's actually working (and what isn't)
3. You get a clear plan with no surprises
4. I build it, you stay in the loop
5. You get a site you understand and can maintain

## This might be for you if

- Your current site embarrasses you
- You're getting traffic but no enquiries
- You've been quoted months and tens of thousands
- You want something that just works
