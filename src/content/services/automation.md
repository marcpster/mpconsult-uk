You're spending hours on tasks a computer could do in seconds.

Data entry. Copy-pasting between systems. Sending the same email for the hundredth time. It's not just boring - it's expensive. Your time is worth more than that.

## What you get

Systems that talk to each other, doing the boring stuff automatically so you can focus on the work that actually needs a human.

- **Tool integration** — Make your systems work together
- **Workflow automation** — Trigger actions automatically
- **Data sync** — No more manual copy-pasting
- **Notification systems** — Know what needs attention
- **Process documentation** — Understand what's happening

## How it works

1. We map out where you're losing time
2. I identify what can (and should) be automated
3. You get a prioritised plan based on impact
4. I build and test the automations
5. You get documentation and training

## This might be for you if

- You're doing the same tasks over and over
- Your tools don't talk to each other
- You've got a spreadsheet that's become mission-critical
- You want to scale without hiring
