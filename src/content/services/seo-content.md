You can have the best service in town, but it doesn't matter if nobody can find you.

SEO doesn't have to be mysterious. It's about making sure that when someone searches for what you do, you show up - and when they land on your site, they find what they need.

## What you get

A clear strategy to get found by the people who are actually looking for your services. No jargon, no smoke and mirrors.

- **Local SEO** — Show up when people search in your area
- **Keyword strategy** — Target the terms your customers actually use
- **Content that works** — Pages that rank and convert
- **Technical foundations** — The behind-the-scenes stuff that matters
- **Honest reporting** — See what's actually happening

## How it works

1. I audit where you're at now
2. We identify the opportunities worth pursuing
3. You get a prioritised plan (not everything at once)
4. I implement the technical stuff
5. You get guidance on content that will actually help

## This might be for you if

- You're invisible on Google
- You're ranking for the wrong things
- You've been burned by SEO "experts" before
- You want to understand what's actually happening
