You're probably collecting data. But are you actually using it?

Most small businesses have Google Analytics installed and... that's it. The data sits there, unloved, while decisions get made on gut feeling. It doesn't have to be that way.

## What you get

Clarity on what's working and what isn't. Simple dashboards that tell you what you need to know - not everything that's technically measurable.

- **Proper tracking setup** — Measure what matters
- **Custom dashboards** — See your numbers at a glance
- **Conversion tracking** — Know where your leads come from
- **Regular insights** — Not just data, but what it means
- **Privacy-friendly options** — GDPR-compliant alternatives to Google

## How it works

1. I audit your current setup (there's usually something broken)
2. We agree what actually matters to track
3. I fix the foundations and set up proper tracking
4. You get a dashboard you'll actually look at
5. I show you what to do with the insights

## This might be for you if

- You don't know where your leads come from
- Your analytics is a mess (or non-existent)
- You want to make decisions based on evidence
- You've got data but don't know what it means
