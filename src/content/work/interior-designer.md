## The problem

A design studio had great work but a website that didn't show it. Slow, hard to update, invisible on Google. All new business came from word-of-mouth and Instagram.

## What I did

Built a fast, modern site that showcases their portfolio properly. Set up local SEO so they appear when people search for designers in their area. Made it easy for them to add new projects without calling a developer.

## The result

Launched in four weeks — not the six months they'd been quoted elsewhere. They're now on Google for local searches, getting qualified leads from people actively looking for designers. And they can update the site themselves.
