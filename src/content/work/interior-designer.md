## The challenge

An interior design studio had a beautiful portfolio but a website that wasn't doing it justice. It was slow, hard to update, and invisible on Google. They were relying entirely on word-of-mouth and Instagram for new business.

## What we did

- Built a fast, modern website that showcased their work properly
- Made it easy for them to add new projects without developer help
- Implemented local SEO so they'd appear for searches in their area
- Set up simple analytics to track where enquiries came from
- Created a Google Business Profile strategy

## The result

The new site launched in four weeks - not the six months they'd been quoted elsewhere. It loads fast, looks great on mobile (where most of their audience browses), and they can update it themselves.

More importantly, they're now appearing in local searches. Qualified leads started coming through organic search within weeks of launch - people actively looking for interior designers in their area.

## What the client said

> "Finally, a website that matches the quality of our work. And I can actually update it myself without breaking anything."
