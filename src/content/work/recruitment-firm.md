## The problem

SearcHive's team were spending 35 hours a month on manual outreach admin. Six different tools, none of them talking to each other. Contacts scattered across spreadsheets and LinkedIn. Email deliverability was suffering because the basics — SPF, DKIM, DMARC — weren't set up properly.

## What I did

Mapped every step of their outreach workflow to find where time was being lost. Designed a streamlined stack — Clay for enrichment, SmartLead for cold email, HubSpot for warm pipeline — replacing six disconnected tools with three that actually work together. Fixed their email infrastructure so messages land in inboxes, not spam.

## The result

SearcHive now have a clear, tested architecture that cuts out the manual busywork. The proof of concept is live and being validated with real campaigns. Early signs are strong — the team can focus on placing candidates instead of wrangling spreadsheets.
