## The challenge

A specialist recruitment firm was drowning in manual processes. Their consultants were spending more time on admin than actually placing candidates. Data lived in spreadsheets, emails, and people's heads. Nothing talked to anything else.

## What we did

- Mapped out every manual touchpoint in their recruitment workflow
- Identified the biggest time drains (candidate tracking was brutal)
- Built automated workflows connecting their ATS, email, and reporting
- Created dashboards so they could see pipeline health at a glance
- Documented everything so the team could maintain it

## The result

The numbers speak for themselves: a 77% reduction in time spent on manual tasks. What used to take 35 hours a month now takes 8. That's not just efficiency - it's giving consultants their time back to do what they're actually good at.

The £139,700 annual value? That's a combination of time saved, better candidate matching, and fewer dropped balls in the process.

## What the client said

> "We knew we were inefficient, but we didn't realise how much until MP showed us the numbers. The automation has transformed how we work."
