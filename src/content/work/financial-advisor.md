## The challenge

An independent financial advisor was investing in marketing but had no idea what was actually working. Money was going into Google Ads, content, and networking - but leads just "appeared" with no clear source. Decisions were made on gut feeling.

## What we did

- Audited existing analytics (it was a mess - duplicate tracking, no goals)
- Set up proper conversion tracking across all channels
- Built a simple dashboard showing lead sources and costs
- Implemented local SEO improvements based on actual search data
- Created a content strategy focused on terms people actually search

## The result

For the first time, the client could see exactly where leads were coming from - and what they cost. This led to cutting underperforming channels and doubling down on what worked.

The local SEO work put them on page 1 for key terms in their area. Combined with better tracking, qualified enquiries tripled within six months.

## What the client said

> "I used to just hope my marketing was working. Now I know exactly what's driving business. It's changed how I think about growth."
