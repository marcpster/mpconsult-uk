## The problem

A financial advisor was spending money on Google Ads, content, and networking — but had no idea what was actually working. Leads just appeared with no clear source. Every marketing decision was a guess.

## What I did

Ripped out the broken analytics, set up proper conversion tracking, and built a dashboard showing exactly where leads come from and what they cost. Then implemented local SEO based on what people actually search for.

## The result

They could finally see what was working — and cut what wasn't. Page 1 rankings for key local terms. Qualified enquiries tripled within six months.
